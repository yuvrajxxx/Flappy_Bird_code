This code is a C++ implementation of the Flappy Bird game.

The code uses the console window to display the game. It uses several libraries such as <iostream>, <windows.h>, <math.h>, <time.h>, and <conio.h>. The class Flappy_Bird represents the game object and contains functions that handle the game logic, such as printing the hurdles, checking for collisions, and updating the score.

The game has four hurdles, and the player controls a bird that moves vertically on the screen. The player must avoid the hurdles by jumping at the right time. If the bird collides with a hurdle, the game is over. The score is incremented each time the bird passes a hurdle.
